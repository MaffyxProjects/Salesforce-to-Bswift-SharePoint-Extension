# Salesforce bswift Enhancement Extension

A Chrome/Edge browser extension that enhances the Salesforce experience by adding convenient utility buttons next to bswift Client IDs. This extension streamlines the workflow for accessing client documents in SharePoint and performing role searches in bswift.

## Features

   - Opens SharePoint document search in a new tab
   - Automatically filters results by the client ID
   - Works with the Audits folder structure

2. **Role Search Button** (bswift icon)
